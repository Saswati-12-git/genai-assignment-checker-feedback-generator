Ferromagnetic materials when subjected to a temporary magnetic field can exhibit a lag or delay in the demagnetisation process due to the material from which they are made. This lag or delay of a magnetic material is known commonly as magnetic hysteresis.
We know that the magnetic flux generated by an electromagnetic coil is the amount of magnetic field or lines of force produced within a given area and that it is more commonly called “Flux Density”. Given the symbol B with the unit of flux density being the Tesla, T.
We also know from the previous tutorials that the magnetic strength of an electromagnet depends upon the number of turns of the coil, the current flowing through the coil or the type of core material being used, and if we increase either the current or the number of turns we can increase the magnetic field strength, symbol H.
